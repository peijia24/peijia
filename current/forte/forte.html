						<h2 class="page-titles sig">The context.</h2>

							<p class="text">The website is targeted towards young individuals who are getting into fitness and towards busy parents, especially moms. Jennifer emphasized that she wanted to show parents that it was possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle while working + raising a family.</p>

								<div class="bizgoals">
									<p class="core-title">Business goals:</p>
									<p class="text">1. A dynamic, easy to maintain site where information about her services could be easily discovered, updated, and understood</p>

				<p class="section-title">Discovery</p>
					<div class="discovery-content">
						<h2 class="discovery-title sig">The exploration.</h2>
						<p class="text">The primary goal for Jennifer's site was to display her services, and offer a way of contact for clients to reach her. Knowing this, we began with a content-first approach in creating her product.</p>

						<p class="text">We asked potential users with an initial survey where 21 random individuals gave their input on personal training and what they would like to see on a site offering fitness services. These individuals ranged from 20s - 30s and 7% were parents.</p>

						<p class="text">Our results informed us of several things:</p>

						<img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/forte-survey-findings-none.jpg">

						<h2 class="idea-title sig">Our idea.</h2>

						<p class="text">When we asked potential users to reflect on what would interest them in actively seeking out a personal trainer or training service, many of them pointed out that:</p>

						<img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/forte-idea-v02.jpg">

						<p class="text">To further help us understand what other fitness trainers offered, we looked at several sites (some examples <a href="https://carmelrodriguez.com/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.jillianmichaels.com/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.tammyhembrow.org/">here</a>) for competitive analysis and to gain insight into the fitness industry.</p>

						<p class="text">From this I created an information architecture that considered what Jennifer wanted, and what was commonly found on other fitness sites.</p>

						<img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/forte-IA.jpg" alt="information architecture for forte is my fitness">

						<p class="text">One different thing she mentioned was she wanted to include a transformation page so that clients can see her services work, and have a blog for SEO purposes.</p>

			<p class="section-title">Creation</p>
				<div class="creation-content">
						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Brand guide.</h2>

						<p class="text">As the project did not include custom brand design, we decided to create a style tile as a foundational basis for ensuring design consistency through out the entire website.</p>

						<img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/style-again.jpg" alt="style guide for website">

						<img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/jrh-moodboard-pub.jpg" alt="initial moodboard for website">

						<p class="text">Looking back, I think it could have been better to create a more cohesive brand design if we were more firm with our suggestions of which colors and designs work optimally with one another versus letting the client choose the colors.</p>

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Desktop wireframes.</h2>

						<p class="text">Our primary focus for this site was focused on desktop development, although it would have been smarter to begin from mobile first design.</p>

						<p class="text">Following on how the IA was laid out and after several reiterations, we decided on creating straight forward wireframes with the main purpose of directing the user flow to go check out who Jennifer is as a trainer, and end up contacting her for her services.</p>

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Mockups.</h2>

						<p class="text">Based off the new wireframes and IA, we integrated it with the brand guidelines to create a mockup of the finished product.</p>

						<!-- mockups here -->

						<p class="text">While Jennifer was happy with our mockups, I personally thought that the mockups could be a little more uniquely designed to create a more creative user experience.</p>

						<p class="text">Here is another version of how the site could have looked, if we only had the time and skills then to develop it!</p>

						<!-- other mockup version here -->

			<p class="section-title">Development</p>
				<div class="development-content">
				
						<h2 class="development-title sig">Implementing WordPress.</h2>
						<p class="text">Once the mockup designs were approved with Jennifer, we went ahead with development. We created a custom WordPress site using a starter theme, creating our own taxonomies and hierarchies. Having a Wordpress site would allow Jennifer the flexibility to change and manager her content as her business grew and changed.</p>

			<p class="section-title">Deliverables</p>
				<div class="deliverables-content">
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<p class="text">After the site was developed on our local sites, it was time to hand it off to the client on her own hosting site.</p>

						<!-- wordpress cms screenshots here -->

						<p class="text">In our last week of class, we showed Jennifer in person how to use the WordPress CMS. She really liked the site when she saw the complete project, although we weren't 100% satisfied with some the bugs that remained. Despite small issues (which we ended up fixing after the program ended), we took it that she liked her site as she based her business card design off of what we created!</p>

						<p class="text">And that wraps up our one month client project, check out the live site <a href="http://www.jenniferrhfitness.com/"><b>here</b></a>!</p>
				</div>

			<p class="section-title">Reflections</p>
				<div class="reflections-content">
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<p class="text">In the end, there were several things I still would have liked to have changed if allowed the time and if our design/development skills were stronger.</p>

						<p class="text">While the starter theme set up a solid base for us to create the site, we faced other issues that we did not expect. Some of the bigger issues included poor communication, working inefficiently, and struggling with unfamiliar softwares.</p>

						<p class="text">For this project, we decided to style the site in SASS and used gulp to automate our development workflow. We were all unfamiliar using these tools, which had an initial learning curve. Once that was figured out, we also began experiencing merge conflicts as we never really worked in a group setting to create a dynamic site together before. But then we adopted the scrum approach,which really cleaned up our workflow!</p>

						<p class="text">However, I am immensely proud of my team and I for creating our first ever 'proper' website! It gave us a chance to see what a front-end developer does on a daily basis as well as what freelance work might be like!</p>

						<p class="text">Overall, we hope that Jennifer's fitness service will continue to grow, especially with the addition of an online platform! <br><br> Thanks for reading!</p>
