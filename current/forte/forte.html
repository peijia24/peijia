					<p class="project-brief text">Fitness is My Forte is a website created for Jennifer RH, a local personal fitness trainer with no previous website or brand identity. Over the last few years, Jennifer had been thinking about opening her own fitness training business after several requests from friends and family, and has decided that this was the year to begin it.</p>

						<h2 class="page-titles sig">The context.</h2>
							<p class="text">This was our final client project for the BCIT TWD program, and it was a project that encompassed what we have learned during our program. This was the first time my team members and I have created a complete website from scratch to launch.</p>

							<p class="core-title">Business goals:</p>
							<p class="text">1. Jennifer wanted a dynamic, easy to maintain site where information about her services could be easily discovered and understood </p>
							<p class="text">2. She ultimately wanted the visitors to contact her and speak to her one on one</p>


							<p class="core-title">Site goals:</p>
							<ul class="site-goals">
								<li>Brand + visual design creation</li>
								<li>A working site with a simple user experience</li>
							</ul>

				<p class="section-title">Discovery</p>
					<div class="discovery-content">
						<h2 class="discovery-title sig">The exploration.</h2>
						<p class="text">Since Jennifer has never had a website before, and her fitness business was just beginning - we begin with a content-first approach in creating her product. </p>

						<p class="text">Some of the key things she wanted in her site  was a contact page, an events page and a blog. However, we wanted to ask users would want to see in personal fitness site.</p>

						<p class="text">We began with an initial survey asking 21 random individuals for their input on what they thought about personal training and what they would like to see on a site offering fitness services.</p>

						<p class="text">Our results informed us several things:</p>

						<p class="list-title text"><strong>Many people have not had any experience with personal training</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>people thought it was too expensive and that personal fitness was not a high priority</li>
							<li>Some were too shy and feared being judged by personal trainers</li>
							<li>People were not interested in personal training or didnâ€™t have time</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="list-title text"><strong>Personal trainers were seen as an informational and skill base to further improve fitness and training methods</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Tended to use personal training services as a way to try or answer questions that is not clear through client's own research</li>
							<li>People were interested in interacting with a personal trainer if they were openly available in their gym</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 class="idea-title sig">Our idea.</h2>

						<p class="text">When we asked users to reflect on what would interest them in actively seeking out a personal trainer or training service, many of them pointed out that:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>services must be <strong>affordable</strong></li>
							<li>the personal trainer must be <strong>relatable, seem approachable to contact</strong></li>
							<li>potential clients would be much more inclined have a <strong>trial service</strong> with the trainer to decide if their personalities and training styles match well together</li>
							<li>offer <strong>group services + prices</strong> so that people new to personal training feel more comfortable and get to know the instructor</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="text">To further help us understand what other fitness trainers offered, we looked at _____ sites for competitive analysis and to gain insight into the fitness industry.</p>

						<p class="text">From the research, I was able to understand that fitness sites generally included:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>home page</li>
							<li>a detailed about me page</li>
							<li>a services pages</li>
							<li>sometimes included a blog or page where new content is added (for seo purposes)</li>
							<li>a contact me page </li>
						</ul>

						<p>From this I created an information architecture that considered all of these factors.</p>

						<!-- IA here lol -->

			<p class="section-title">Creation</p>
				<div class="creation-content">
						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Brand guide.</h2>
						<p class="text">Jennifer did not request to have us create a logo design, nor was it part of our client project requirements since we primarily focused on development. Instead she wanted her name in a clean font against a solid background. Knowing this, we searched for a clean font and ended up choosing Barlow from Google Fonts.</p>

						<p class="text">It was also important for Jennifer to include her favourite color, a turquoise-blue shade. We decided that this would be the feature color for her brand. Other things she specifically wanted us to include was to create a clean interface with clean cut colours such as black, white or grey.</p>

						<!-- brand guide here -->

						<p class="text">Looking back, I think it could have been better to create a more cohesive brand design if we were more firm with our suggestions of which colors and designs work optimally with one another versus letting the client choose the colors.<br>If given more time, we could have shown her more alternatives to different brand guides.</p>

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Desktop wireframes.</h2>

						<p class="text">Our primary focus for this site was focused on desktop development, although it would have been smarter to begin from mobile first design.</p>

						<p class="text">Following on how the IA was laid out and after several reiterations, we decided on creating these wireframes.</p>

						<p class="text">Check out the complete wireframes here!</p>

						<!-- wireframes first paper then sketch/invision -->
						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Mockups.</h2>

						<p class="text">Based off the new wireframes and IA, we integrated it with the brand guidelines to create a mockup of the finished product.</p>

						<!-- mockups here -->

						<p class="text">While Jennifer was happy with our mockups, I personally thought that the mockups could be a little more uniquely designed to create a fun and smooth user experience.</p>

						<p class="text">Here is another version of how the site could have looked, if we only had the time and skills then to develop it!</p>

						<!-- other mockup version here -->
				</div>

			<p class="section-title">Development</p>
				<div class="development-content">
				
						<h2 class="development-title sig">Implementing WordPress.</h2>
						<p class="text">Once the mockups were approved with Jennifer, we went ahead with development. We created a custom WordPress site using a starter theme, creating our own taxonomies and hierarchies.</p>

						<p class="text">Using WordPress allowed us to use the skills and tools that we've learned through out this program, and it gives Jennifer the flexibility to change and manage her content as she wished. This ensures that her site stays updated and allows opportunities to change and grow her brand when the time came.</p>

						<!-- instagram pics and dev pics -->

				</div>

			<p class="section-title">Deliverables</p>
				<div class="deliverables-content">
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<p class="text">After the site was developed on our local sites, it was time to hand it off to the client on her own hosting site.</p>

						<!-- wordpress cms screenshots here -->

						<p class="text">In our last week of class, we showed Jennifer in person how to use the WordPress CMS. She really liked the site when she saw the complete project, although we weren't 100% satisfied with some the bugs that remained. Despite small issues (which we ended up fixing after the program ended), we took it that she liked her site as she based her business card design off of what we created!</p>

						<!-- business card here -->

						<p class="text">And that wraps up our one month client project, check out the live site here!</p>
				</div>

			<p class="section-title">Reflections</p>
				<div class="reflections-content">
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<p class="text">In the end, there were several things I still would have liked to have changed if allowed the time and if our design/development skills were stronger.</p>

						<p class="text">While the starter theme set up a solid base for us to create the site, we faced other issues that we did not expect. Some of the bigger issues included poor communication, working inefficiently, and struggling with unfamiliar softwares.</p>

						<p class="text">For this project, we decided to style the site in SASS and used gulp to automate our development workflow. We were all unfamiliar using these tools, which had an initial learning curve. Once that was figured out, we also began experiencing merge conflicts as we never really worked in a group setting to create a dynamic site together before. But then we adopted the scrum approach,which really cleaned up our workflow!</p>

						<p class="text">However, I am immensely proud of my team and I for creating our first ever 'proper' website! It gave us a chance to see what a front-end developer does on a daily basis as well as what freelance work might be like!</p>

						<p class="text">Overall, we hope that Jennifer's fitness service will continue to grow, especially with the addition of an online platform! Thanks for reading!</p>
