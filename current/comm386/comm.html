						<h2 class="page-titles sig">The situation.</h2>

							<p class="text">Have you ever went to a cafe or library only to find out that there’s no more seats or that it’s super busy? Even though you googled beforehand to see reviews of how good their lattes are or if there were study rooms available, and saw that the google estimated time right now is less busy than usual, the information turned out to be inaccurate :(</p>

							<p class="text">So now you have to find another location, and you’re awkwardly loitering around looking for the next place - but again, it might be busy too… So what should you do?</p>

						<img src="../../current/comm386/comm-images/comm-opp-sf.jpg" alt="is there a more accurate way to collect and optimize accurate data for waiting times and seat availabilities that is verified by both users and business owners?" class="forte-question">

					</div>



				<p class="section-title">Discovery</p>
					<div class="discovery-content">
						<h2 class="discovery-title sig">The exploration.</h2>
						<p class="text">Recently, I was getting a bit frustrated with going to a cafe or a library only to find out that it is packed - despite planning ahead (I mean, other people are planning smartly too though!). That means then I would have to get to another library or cafe, which may also be full and decreases the amount of time I have for actual work because I have to look and get to another place.</p>

						<p class="text">So I thought, what is there as a way - sort of like Yelp reviews but more real-time - to confirm actual waiting times and seat availabilites for any places that would have a wait, seats or is a shared community space?</p>

						<p class="text">I went with the direction that this app should primarily focus on getting the users to verify how busy an establishment was, and how it could display the data gathered in an easy to understand way for users (both customers and owners).</p>

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">The idea.</h2>
						
						<p class="text">From this, I took inspiration from both the Yelp app and Google Forms/Google Materials design as a design guide for my concept.</p>

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Mockups.</h2>

						<p class="text">Based off the new wireframes and IA, we integrated it with the brand guidelines to create a mockup of the finished product.</p>

						<img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/jrh-bcit-mockup.jpg" alt="initial mockups for jrh">

						<!-- mockups here -->

						<p class="text">While Jennifer was happy with our mockups, I personally thought that the mockups could be a little more uniquely designed to create a more creative user experience.</p>

						<p class="text">Here is another version of how the site could have looked, if we only had the time and skills then to develop it!</p>

						<!-- other mockup version here -->

				<div class="development-content">
				
						<h2 class="development-title sig">Implementing WordPress.</h2>
						<p class="text">Once the mockup designs were approved with Jennifer, we went ahead with development. We created a custom WordPress site using a starter theme, creating our own taxonomies and hierarchies. Having a Wordpress site would allow Jennifer the flexibility to change and manager her content as her business grew and changed.</p>

				</div>

			<p class="section-title">Deliverables</p>
				<div class="deliverables-content">
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<p class="text">After the site was developed on our local sites, it was time to hand it off to the client on her own hosting site.</p>

						<!-- wordpress cms screenshots here -->

						<p class="text">In our last week of class, we showed Jennifer in person how to use the WordPress CMS. She really liked the site when she saw the complete project, although we weren't 100% satisfied with some the bugs that remained. Despite small issues (which we tried fixing after the program ended), we took it that she liked her site as she based her business card design off of what we created!</p>

						<img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/forte-card.png" alt="Forte is my Fitness business card" class="card-img">

						<p class="text">And that wraps up our one month client project, check out the live site <a href="http://www.jenniferrhfitness.com/"><b>here</b></a>!</p>

	<!-- 		<p class="section-title">Reflections</p>
				<div class="reflections-content"> -->
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<!-- <p class="text">In the end, there were several things I still would have liked to have changed if allowed the time and if our design/development skills were stronger.</p>

						<p class="text">While the starter theme set up a solid base for us to create the site, we faced other issues that we did not expect. Some of the bigger issues included poor communication, working inefficiently, and struggling with unfamiliar softwares.</p>

						<p class="text">For this project, we decided to style the site in SASS and used gulp to automate our development workflow. We were all unfamiliar using these tools, which had an initial learning curve. Once that was figured out, we also began experiencing merge conflicts as we never really worked in a group setting to create a dynamic site together before. But then we adopted the scrum approach,which really cleaned up our workflow!</p>

						<p class="text">However, I am immensely proud of my team and I for creating our first ever 'proper' website! It gave us a chance to see what a front-end developer does on a daily basis as well as what freelance work might be like!</p>

						<p class="text">Overall, we hope that Jennifer's fitness service will continue to grow, especially with the addition of an online platform! <br><br> Thanks for reading!</p> -->
