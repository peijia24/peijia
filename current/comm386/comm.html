Thus this would create a balanced and verified platform for people to check the location before heading there!</p>

						<h2 class="page-titles sig">The situation.</h2>

							<p class="text">Have you ever went to a cafe or library only to find out that there’s no more seats or that it’s super busy? Even though you googled beforehand to see reviews of how good their lattes are or if there were study rooms available, and saw that the google estimated time right now is less busy than usual, the information turned out to be inaccurate :(</p>

							<p class="text">So now you have to find another location, and you’re awkwardly loitering around looking for the next place - but again, it might be busy too… So what should you do?</p>

						<img src="../../current/comm386/comm-images/comm-opp-updated.jpg" alt="is there a more accurate way to collect and optimize accurate data for waiting times and seat availabilities that is verified by both users and business owners?" class="forte-question">

					</div>



				<p class="section-title">Discovery</p>
					<div class="discovery-content">
						<h2 class="discovery-title sig">The exploration.</h2>
						<p class="text">Recently, I've been getting a bit frustrated going to a cafe or a library only to find out that it is packed - despite planning ahead and checking the hours. That means then I would have to get to another library or cafe, which may also be full and decreases the amount of time I have for actual work because I have to look and get to another place.</p>

						<p class="text">So I thought, what is there as a way - sort of like Yelp reviews but more real-time - to confirm actual waiting times and seat availabilites for any places that would have a wait, seats or is a shared community space?</p>

						<p class="text">I went with the direction that this app should primarily focus on getting the users to verify how busy an establishment was, and how it could display the data gathered in an easy to understand way for users (both customers and owners).</p>

			<p class="section-title">Creation</p>
				<div class="creation-content">
						<h2 class="creation-title sig">The idea.</h2>
						
						<p class="text">From this, I took inspiration from the Yelp app, Transit app and Google Tasks/Google Materials design as design inspiration for my app concept.</p>
						
						<img src="../../current/comm386/comm-images/comm-inspired.jpg">

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Initial designs.</h2>

						<p class="text">For this class, we only had one week to come up with an app concept, and I took inspiration from Yelp, Transit, and Google Tasks without truely considering why it should be designed like this. Which produced these initial mockups:</p>

						<!-- mockups here -->

						<img src="../../current/comm386/comm-images/comm-original-1.jpg">
						<img src="../../current/comm386/comm-images/comm-original-2.jpg">
						<img src="../../current/comm386/comm-images/comm-original-3.jpg">

						<p class="text">However, I got some key feedback for my initial designs, which included:</p>

							<p class="core-title">Things to improve for the UI:</p>
							<p class="text"><b>1.</b> The buttons and call-to-action cues where too small and narrow.</p>
							<p class="text"><b>2.</b> There was too much information on the screen at once. Hard to read and understand; may be difficult to use for people with larger hands or are clumsy.</p>
							<p class="text"><b>3.</b> Design is generic; gets to the point but not exciting to use.</p>
							<p class="text"><b>4.</b> How can the app be better catered to the business side's user experience? How to delegate incentives on this end of the users?</p>

					<!-- updated designs + reflection -->

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Improved designs.</h2>

						<p class="text">Understanding what I could improve on, I went back to the design board. I decided to change the color scheme a little big, and looked closer at why I chose Yelp, Transit and Google Material Design initially.</p>

						<div class="goals">
							<div class="bizgoals">
								<p class="core-title">Yelp:</p>
								<ul>
								  <li>Easy to find information, and information present is intuitively organized</li>
								  <li>Reviews are placed by real users</li>
								  <li>Intuitive switch between real-time map, detailed pages, and lists</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="sitegoals">
								<p class="core-title">Transit:</p>
								<ul>
								  <li>Central search button makes it easy to search</li>
								  <li>List view slides up to show all available options</li>
								  <li>Provides all the information without unnecessary overload</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="sitegoals">
								<p class="core-title">Google Tasks/Google Material Design:</p>
								<ul>
								  <li>Clean, clear design</li>
								  <li>Buttons, popups and forms are easily recognized and to be used</li>
								  <li>Login with Google account</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
