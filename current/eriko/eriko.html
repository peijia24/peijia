				<h2 class="sub-title">Site Design & Development</h2>
					<h3 class="timeline">freelance client project<br>(3 weeks, summer 2018)</h3>
					<p class="text">Eriko Semitsu is an award-winning floral designer based in Vancouver. I met her when I first joined Celsia Floral in 2016, and followed closely in her footsteps as a mentee in learning floral design. Her art styles are influenced by traditional Japanese elements, as well as organic + botanical feelings.</p>
					<p class="project-brief-bottom text">For some time now, Eriko has been wanting to have a website to display her work and thoughts so that other designers and artists could see her perspective in floral design. However, she didn't want to just create one on Wordpress or Squarespace. This provided the perfect opportunity for me to create a personal website for her, which I took on as a challenge! </p>

						<h2 class="question-title sig">The question.</h2>
							<p class="question text">How can we create a <strong>responsive, sustainable website</strong> for a personal trainer with no previous web and brand identity?</p>
						<h2 class="page-titles sig">The context.</h2>
							<p class="text">This was our final client project for the BCIT TWD program, and it was a project that encompassed what we have learned during our program.</p><p class="text">The website is targeted towards young individuals who are getting into fitness and towards busy parents, especially moms. Jennifer emphasized that she wanted to show parents that it was possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle while working + raising a family.</p>

							<p class="core-title">Business goals:</p>
							<p class="text">1. A dynamic, easy to maintain site where information about her services could be easily discovered, updated, and understood</p>
							<p class="text">2. The goal is to ultimately have potential clients to contact Jennifer and speak to her one on one about her services</p>


							<p class="core-title">Site goals:</p>
							<p class="text">1. Visual design + branding</p>
							<p class="text">2. Organized, easy to find content</p>
 -->
					</div>



				<p class="section-title">Discovery</p>
					<div class="discovery-content">
						<h2 class="discovery-title sig">The exploration.</h2>
						<p class="text">Eriko had a specific mood and feel she wanted to capture in her website, such as "raw, old, Wabi-Sabi, Eikoseisui(栄枯盛衰)". She wanted to convey an aesthetics like an old film picture that is very simple and as is.</p>

						<p class="text">*Eikoseisui means the ups and downs of life :)</p>

						<p class="text">Because the primary goal of this website was more of a personal collection, I decided not to go forward with research or following business goals.</p>

						<p class="text">Thus, we had several coffee chats about what kind of content she wanted to include on her site, which included: home page, gallery, thoughts page and an about page.</p>

						<!-- <p class="list-title text"><strong>Many people have not had any experience with personal training</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>people thought it was too expensive</li>
							<li>personal fitness and a healthy lifestyle is not a high priority due to lack of time, motivation, desire or interest</li>
							<li>Some were too shy and feared being judged by personal trainers</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="list-title text"><strong>Personal trainers were seen as an informational and skill base to further improve fitness and training methods</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>tended to use personal training services as a way to try or answer questions that is not clear through client's own research</li>
							<li>personal training was considered to be for things such as fitness competitions, body building, performance/athletic training, etc.</li>
							<li>people were interested in interacting with a personal trainer if they were openly available in their gym</li>
						</ul>
 -->
						<!-- <h2 class="idea-title sig">Our idea.</h2>

						<p class="text">When we asked potential users to reflect on what would interest them in actively seeking out a personal trainer or training service, many of them pointed out that:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>services must be <strong>affordable</strong></li>
							<li>the personal trainer must be <strong>relatable, seem approachable to contact</strong></li>
							<li>potential clients would be much more inclined if a <strong>trial service</strong> was offered, to see if they like the services provided and that the clients get along with the trainer</li>
							<li>offer <strong>group services + prices</strong> so that people new to personal training feel more comfortable and get to know the instructor and personal training</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="text">To further help us understand what other fitness trainers offered, we looked at several sites (some examples <a href="https://carmelrodriguez.com/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.jillianmichaels.com/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.tammyhembrow.org/">here</a>) for competitive analysis and to gain insight into the fitness industry.</p>

						<p class="text">From the research, I was able to understand that fitness sites generally included:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>home page</li>
							<li>a detailed about me page</li>
							<li>a services pages</li>
							<li>sometimes included a blog or page where new content is added (for seo purposes)</li>
							<li>a contact me page </li>
						</ul>

						<p class="text">It was important for fitness service websites to show who the trainer is, what type of person they are and why they love fitness, and exactly what the trainer offered. </p>

						<p class="text">From this I created an information architecture that considered all of this information. Jennifer told us she also wanted to include a transformation page to show potential clients that her services will help them in shape!</p>

			<p class="section-title">Creation</p>
				<div class="creation-content">
						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Design stuff.</h2>
						<p class="text">There was no logo design needed as Eriko was not aiming to create a brand.
							<br>
							<br>
						I asked Eriko to think of several ideas for a potential favicon logo, and she decided on a grey version of the Japanese flag. </p>

						<!-- <p class="text">It was also important for Jennifer to include her favourite color, a turquoise-blue shade. We decided that this would be the feature color for her brand. Other things she specifically wanted us to include was to create a clean interface with clean cut colours such as black, white or grey.</p> -->

						<!-- <img src="../../current/forte/forte-images/style-tile-jrh.jpg" alt="style guide for website">

						<p class="text">Looking back, I think it could have been better to create a more cohesive brand design if we were more firm with our suggestions of which colors and designs work optimally with one another versus letting the client choose the colors.</p> -->

						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Desktop wireframes.</h2>

						<p class="text">Our primary focus for this site was focused on desktop development, although it would have been smarter to begin from mobile first design.</p>

						<p class="text">Following on how the IA was laid out and after several reiterations, we decided on creating these wireframes.</p>

						<p class="text">Check out the complete wireframes here!</p>

						<!-- wireframes first paper then sketch/invision -->
						<h2 class="creation-title sig">Mockups.</h2>

						<p class="text">Based off the new wireframes and IA, we integrated it with the brand guidelines to create a mockup of the finished product.</p>

						<!-- mockups here -->

						<p class="text">While Jennifer was happy with our mockups, I personally thought that the mockups could be a little more uniquely designed to create a fun and smooth user experience.</p>

						<p class="text">Here is another version of how the site could have looked, if we only had the time and skills then to develop it!</p>

						<!-- other mockup version here -->

			<p class="section-title">Development</p>
				<div class="development-content">
				
						<h2 class="development-title sig">Implementing WordPress.</h2>
						<p class="text">I decided to hard code the website because I thought it would be easier to maintain and change than having to introduce Wordpress and its content management system to Eriko. She agreed with me, and I told her that the only difficulty was updating the images and thoughts page - although I could help her with it when needed.</p>

						<p class="text">As the sole project lead, I had full control over what I wanted to create. Beginning with a mobile first approach, I followed the approved wireframe designs and made it responsive over a collective time of 3 weeks.</p>

						<!-- instagram pics and dev pics -->

			<p class="section-title">Deliverables</p>
				<div class="deliverables-content">
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<p class="text">Finally, the live website was finished! You can view the site here :) </p>

						<!-- wordpress cms screenshots here -->

						<!-- <p class="text">In our last week of class, we showed Jennifer in person how to use the WordPress CMS. She really liked the site when she saw the complete project, although we weren't 100% satisfied with some the bugs that remained. Despite small issues (which we ended up fixing after the program ended), we took it that she liked her site as she based her business card design off of what we created!</p> -->

						<!-- business card here -->

						<!-- <p class="text">And that wraps up our one month client project, check out the live site <a href="http://www.jenniferrhfitness.com/">here</a>!</p> -->
				</div>

			<p class="section-title">Reflections</p>
				<div class="reflections-content">
						<!-- <h2 class="deliverables-title sig"></h2> -->
						<p class="text">I think the biggest issue was deciding on the design and function of the website, which actually matured from a youthful and bright initial design to the current dark and moody one. </p>

						<p class="text">The original moodboard for this website looked liked this!</p>

						<p class="text">Other than that, Eriko was a very understanding and accommodating friend to work with (well I mean I guess since we work at the same place!). She put up with alot of my nooby first timer-ish mistakes and was very open to suggestions I made. This was a fun development project for me over the summer :) </p>

						<p class="text">Thanks for reading!</p>

					<!-- 	<p class="text">Overall, we hope that Jennifer's fitness service will continue to grow, especially with the addition of an online platform! <br><br> Thanks for reading!</p> -->
